===================

What specific result i will get today in the App ?


*Thoughts chaotics*

	
I want to finish the home page

What needs to happens in order to consider the home page finished ?

1. I need a Header for navigate to other pages and give the welcome

2. I need The Content which will be consume by the user
	1. [X] I need a Welcome Component <Welcome />
	2. [ ] I need show who is paty, I mean a Powerful About Me Component <AboutMe />
	3. [ ] I need show the Magic Paty creates, her artworks <Artworks />
	4. [ ] All this is okey, but i need to show what Paty can and want do for You <Services />
	5. [ ] People wanna see what happens today, now, I need her updated arts platforms <SocialNetworks />
	6. [ ] Enough ? Yes but i wanna talk with her what can i do, i need show how people can contact her <Contact />


3. I need a footer to refocus the user to contact pages or help him visit secondary pages


What need to happens in order to consider 1.2 finished?

*Action Plan*
-------------

1. [X] Contains the Home Page in the Page Component
2. Specify the content for About Me


*New Ideas*

*What´s next?*


Next will go make the specific pages using React Router as i see



*Disorder*
---------

Concentrate, deberia colocar los subcomponente dentro del dumb o dentro del inteligente
El inteligente porque él es el contenedor
