Free thoughts

I know Paty can serve other people and that also she wants to do it

She can do it draw

For her draw is a way to communicate, to express something that need to be expressed

She can help in the decoration of places like restaurants


She can do it designing a Dresses for girls or for a brand


She can sing

She can animate people

She is funny, she delight with her energy, she connects with bodys

What is the Paty´s HADA ?

She draw every day, she spent time in her art i loved art
She makes me laugh, 
She express her love
She listen and make me express
She takes action in important things
She makes me experience the world through her eye
She express love, energy in her things


1. Comunicar más con Dibujos
2. Diseñar TE vestuario

Comunicar sin palabras

A
